## About Myself

My name is Rajesh Krishnan. I am a US citizen of Indian origin, and I currently live in Fort Valley, Virginia, USA. 

I am a retired computer engineer by profession.  You can find a list of my patents, publications, and technical reports on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=aMfW5dMAAAAJ&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate).

My other interests include minimalism, veganism, and sanatana dharma (especially yoga and vedanta).
